# Exercises to repeat before the test


1. Write a script that searches in the directory given as an argument for all files with the *sh* extension, modified not earlier than 7 days ago, and grants them execution rights.

2. Write a script that will count and print the sum of characters in all files given as arguments. 

3. Write a script that will create a *pictures_backup* folder in your home directory, copy all files with the *jpg* extension in the current directory to it, and then change the new files to read-only.

4. Write a script that will grant the files appropriate access rights based on the *file* - *access rights in numeric notation* argument pairs. For example:

```bash
./task_6.sh file1.txt 467 file2.txt 777 file3.txt 577
```

5. Write a script that will add the text specified as the first argument at the end of a file specified by the second argument.

6. Write a script that will display the first line from the end of the file given as the first argument, the second line from the end of the file given as the second argument, and so on.

  
7. Write a script that works in a loop, reads the PID  of the process from the keyboard, the signal number and then sends the indicated signal to the specified process. Entering the word `EXIT` ends the script.
